# womeninstem

Seems weird that women in STEM are having their work removed from public websites. No one who contributes work to a project should have their information removed.

This repository will be an open source project where anyone can contribute information about a woman in STEM.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to an open source project. 

- Design
- Code
- Content
- Issue review
- Pull request review
- Quality review

## Expectations

Submit information that can be verified.
Be kind.
