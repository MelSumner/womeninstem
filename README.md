# womeninstem

Seems weird that women in STEM are having their work removed from public websites. No one who contributes work to a project should have their information removed.

This repository will be an open source project where anyone can contribute information about a woman in STEM.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to an open source project. 

- Design
- Code
- Content
- Issue review
- Pull request review
- Quality review

## Expectations

1. Submit information that can be verified.
2. Be kind.

## Adding or updating information

To request that information is added or updated, please visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/MelSumner/womeninstem/issues) and interact with the "New Issue" link (it looks like a button).

This will give you the option to select an issue template that works best for your situation. Currently, there are three options:

1. Add a new record
2. Update a record
3. Create an issue from blank

Please choose the one that works best for you.

Please fill in as much information as you are able.

Thank you for contributing!
